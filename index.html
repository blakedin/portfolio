                <p>
                  After bartending for nearly fifteen years I found myself out
                  of a job at the beginning of the pandemic. Once all the bread
                  was baked and all the Netflix shows were watched, I turned to
                  coding as something to do to pass the time. What started as a
                  hobby quickly grew into an obsession. And three years later
                  (has it been three years already?), here I am, ready and eager
                  to enter the exciting world of web development!
                </p>
                <p>
                  In adition to JavaScript, HTML and CSS; I have some experience
                  with C and C++ related technologies such as

                  currious) developer, don't hesitate to reach out! I'm looking
                  forward to contributing to, and growing with, your team!
